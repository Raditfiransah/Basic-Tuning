# Fine-Tuning Playground

> Exploring fine-tuning techniques, from basic matrix operations to LoRA and QLoRA methods.

This repository is a personal learning space — still under construction 🛠️.  
Soon will be filled with study notes, experiments, and small projects related to fine-tuning AI models.
